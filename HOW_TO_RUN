## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- A working Selenium (Chrome) environment
  - Google Chrome installed locally
  - ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version
- Network access that can open Google Maps

### Dependencies
This project includes a `requirements.txt`
containing the minimum libraries required to run the pipeline.

Install dependencies with:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

### Required Worker Contract (Selenium)
This repository does not ship the Selenium worker implementation.
You must provide your own worker implementation and wire it into the runner.

- In `google_map_runner.py`, `temporary_setup()` raises `NotImplementedError`
  by default. Replace its body to create and return your own `SetupGoogleMap`
  instance.

Required contract:

- Class: `SetupGoogleMap`
- Method: `run()`

After calling `run()`, the instance must expose:
- `rt_session`: a session object used by the usecase
  (must provide Selenium actions like `access_url_selenium()`, `fetch_html()`,
  plus Google Maps helpers if used).

### Execute
From the project root (where `src/` exists):

- python -m src.google_map_runner

Run from the project root directory.
No PYTHONPATH configuration is required.

Execution parameters (keyword, number of result cards,
number of reviews) are currently defined directly in `MapContext`. 

### Example (Minimal Run):
- keyword: "bar"
- num_target_search_results: 5
- num_target_review: 10

### Output Note
During execution, the pipeline saves:
- HTML snapshots (Overview / Review) per place
- CSV output extracted from the saved HTML 

Because HTML is saved, you can update selectors later
and re-run only the extraction step if needed.
